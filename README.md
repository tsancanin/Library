# Library – Web API (.NET Core)

Web API project implemented using **C# / .NET Core**, focused on practicing backend structure, object-oriented design, and repository pattern usage.

## Overview
This project represents a simple backend library application created to better understand how data is structured, accessed, and managed within a Web API environment.

## Technologies
- C# / .NET Core
- Web API
- Repository pattern
- SQL database

## Key Concepts
- Object-oriented programming principles
- Separation of concerns
- Data access abstraction using repository pattern
- Basic API structure and request handling

## Purpose
The project was developed as a learning exercise to strengthen understanding of backend architecture and clean code organization, with a focus on how these aspects affect system behavior.

## QA Perspective
From a testing standpoint, this project helped improve understanding of:
- How backend structure impacts testability
- Typical failure points related to data handling
- Logical flow between API layers and database
- More effective bug analysis through better knowledge of implementation details
